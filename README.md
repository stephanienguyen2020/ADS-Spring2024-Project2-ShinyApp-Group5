In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app using **the OpenFEMA data sets**. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  


## Project Title: Geospatial Insights and Forecasting for Fire Incident Preparedness

+ **Project summary**:
	+ The increasing occurrence of fire incidents, driven by factors such as climate change and human encroachment into vulnerable areas, presents a significant challenge for effective management and mitigation efforts. Current approaches to understanding and preparing for these incidents often rely on static, historical data, lacking the capacity for real-time analysis and spatial awareness. The absence of accessible, user-friendly tools that offer geospatial visualization of fire risk areas based on historical data limits proactive planning and community engagement in fire preparedness strategies. This project provides a straightforward, data-driven solution that leverages existing datasets to provide intuitive, geospatial visualizations of fire incident risks, enhancing the overall preparedness and awareness of potential fire threats among various stakeholders.

	+ We develop a shiny app for Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization based on [the OpenFEMA Data Sets](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets).
